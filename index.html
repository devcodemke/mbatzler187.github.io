<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Mike. You have probably never heard of me before, but you have heard of my ex-girlfriend. Her name is Carrie Underwood. We were highschool sweethearts, and we played in a Fleetwood Mac cover band back in the day. We were together for the longest time until she decided to go try out for American Idol, and that is where things went south.</p></div>
<div class="p1">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently some of the other contestants were a better fit for her romantic interests, so we went our seperate ways and agreed to date other people... or so I thought.</p></div>

<h3>Trying To Move On</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was out at the bar trying to pick up chicks, Crazy Carrie (as I like to call her when she flips) decided that I'm not allowed to be doing that and she slashed my tires and keyed my car. To make matters worse, she wrote a song about about it and now everyone in the world assumes she is in the clear and sides with her.</p>
<p>I still miss that crazy chick... maybe I should write a song about it.</p>

<h3>My Revenge</h3>
<p>Being a musician myself, I figured I would try and take the same path that Carrie did. I auditioned for American Idol and made it to the second round where I decided to take a risk and play an original song I wrote that was the opposing side of Carries hit song.</p></div>

<h3>What's Worse?</h3>
<p>While I was playing my song on the main stage, I didn't think about the producers would be recording the audio of the session. Simon Cowell was grinning from ear to ear the whole time, but yet they cut me after the performance. Two months later, I find out that the producers of American Idol sold my song to Nickelback as I heard it on the radio.<br>Sup with that?!</p></div>
