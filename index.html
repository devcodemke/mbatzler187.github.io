<p>Hi, my name is Mike.<Br>
You have probably never heard of me before, but you have heard of my ex-girlfriend. Her name is Carrie Underwood. We were highschool sweethearts, and we played in a Fleetwood Mac cover band back in the day. We were together for the longest time until she decided to go try out for American Idol, and that is where things went south.</p>
<p>Apparently some of the other contestants were a better fit for her romantic interests, so we went our seperate ways and agreed to date other people.<br>
...or so I thought.<br>
While I was out at the bar trying to pick up chicks, Crazy Carrie (as I like to call her when she flips) decided that I'm not allowed to be doing that and she slashed my tires and keyed my car. To make matters worse, she wrote a song about about it and now everyone in the world assumes she is in the clear and sides with her.</p>
<p>I still miss that crazy chick... maybe I should write a song about it.</p>
